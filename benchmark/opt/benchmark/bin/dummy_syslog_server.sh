# Note, a double wait needed to fully and gracfull wait for singal propergation to take affect before exiting.
# - Without the double wait, the execution of the trap function call/commands seems to get missed out when measuring this script with /usr/bin/time
# - The kill command simply issues a singal and returns immediatly as well
# - So a second wait in the cleanup function is needed to ensure this calling script doesn't exit (and time stops measuring) before nc child processes have stopped.
# See: http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_12_02.html
# "When Bash is waiting for an asynchronous command via the wait built-in, the reception of a signal for which a trap has been set will cause the wait built-in to return immediately with an exit status greater than 128, immediately after which the trap is executed."
